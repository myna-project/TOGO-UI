# TOGO-UI
TOGO-UI provide a graphical interface to the REST services exposed by [TOGO](https://github.com/myna-project/TOGO).
##### Why Togo?
TOGO (October 17, 1913 – December 5, 1929) was the lead sled dog of musher Leonhard Seppala and his dog sled team. He was one of the heros of the "Serum run", the transport of diphtheria antitoxin by dog sled relay across the U.S. territory of Alaska by 20 mushers and about 150 sled dogs across 674 miles (1,085 km) in 5 ½ days, saving the small town of Nome and the surrounding communities from a developing epidemic. Why Togo and not Balto? Togo, despite the greater fame of Balto, was the dog who run across the longest part of the relay race (Balto 55 miles, Togo 260 miles).
